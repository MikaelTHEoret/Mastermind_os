# Mastermind: AI-Powered Operating System Interface

## Vision & Purpose
Mastermind is an ambitious project that aims to create an intelligent, self-evolving system interface that bridges human interaction with complex computing systems. It's designed to function as a virtual operating system layer that enhances human-computer interaction through AI-powered agents, automated task management, and intelligent resource optimization.

### Core Philosophy
- **Intelligent Automation**: Leverage AI to automate complex tasks while maintaining human oversight
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously evolve and improve through experience and data analysis
- **Resource Optimization**: Smart allocation and management of computing resources
- **Seamless Integration**: Unified interface for various AI models and computing resources
- **Distributed Computing**: Scale across multiple machines while maintaining centralized control
