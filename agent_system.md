# Agent System: Modular Execution Framework

The Agent System is the backbone of Mastermindâ€™s operational capability. By dividing tasks into specialized units, the system achieves scalability, security, and robust performance.

## Agent Types and Roles:
1. **Johnny Go Getter**:
   - Handles resource optimization by determining whether tasks should be executed locally or via external APIs.
   - Uses heuristic algorithms to calculate the cost-performance ratio of each decision.
   - Example: For a computation-heavy task, it evaluates CPU availability locally and compares it against cloud API costs before making a decision.

2. **Sir Executor**:
   - Converts user input (often in natural language) into actionable commands.
   - Enforces strict protocol adherence to ensure secure and efficient execution.
   - Example: A user asks to "fetch system stats"; Sir Executor translates this into system-specific API calls.

3. **Worker Class**:
   - Executes specific tasks in isolated environments to maintain security and stability.
   - Operates within strict permission boundaries, ensuring minimal impact on the broader system.
   - Example: A Worker Class agent might execute a file conversion script while maintaining isolation to prevent data leakage.

## Security Features:
- Sandboxed execution environments for each agent.
- Role-based access control to prevent unauthorized actions.

## Planned Enhancements:
- Self-improving agents with reinforcement learning capabilities.
- Integration with third-party APIs for expanding functionality.
