# Distributed Computing: Scalability and Resilience

Distributed Computing in Mastermind provides the infrastructure needed to handle large-scale computational tasks efficiently while ensuring system robustness.

## Core Functionalities:
1. **Multi-Node Operation**:
   - Nodes discover each other dynamically using decentralized protocols.
   - Resource sharing ensures balanced workloads across the network.
   - Example: A rendering task is split into chunks and distributed across available nodes.

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Prevents bottlenecks by distributing tasks evenly across nodes.
   - Uses predictive algorithms to preemptively allocate resources based on task demand.

3. **Failover Mechanism**:
   - Ensures system reliability by rerouting tasks from failed nodes to operational ones.
   - Example: If a node crashes mid-task, its workload is reassigned to another node.

4. **Security**:
   - Inter-node communications are encrypted using modern cryptographic protocols.
   - Permissions are strictly enforced to prevent unauthorized data access.

## Planned Features:
- Integration with quantum computing for high-end tasks.
- Predictive scaling for cost-efficient resource usage.
