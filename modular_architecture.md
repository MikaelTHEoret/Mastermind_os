# Modular Architecture: Flexibility at Scale

Mastermindâ€™s modular architecture is a testament to its adaptability, allowing developers to introduce new functionalities or update existing ones without compromising system integrity.

## Capabilities:
1. **Dynamic Module Loading**:
   - New modules can be added, removed, or updated during runtime without restarting the system.
   - Example: A user installs a new analytics module that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows.

2. **Sandboxed Environments**:
   - Each module operates within a secure, isolated environment to prevent conflicts or disruptions.
   - Example: A third-party plugin is tested in isolation before being approved for integration.

3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Ensures that modules are free from vulnerabilities or malicious code.
   - Example: A security scan checks for outdated dependencies in a newly installed module.

## Benefits:
- Encourages rapid feature development.
- Maintains system stability and security even during major updates.
- Supports both internal and third-party module development.
